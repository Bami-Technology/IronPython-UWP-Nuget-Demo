# IronPython-UWP-Nuget-Demo

This is an example of using the nuget packages IronPython2.UWP.Unoffcial and IronPython3.UWP.Unoffcial.

In the two projects, there will be a button test on the interface after startup. After clicking it, a for i in range(0, count) expression will be calculated. If you use the specially processed nuget package, it will crash in the release environment.
